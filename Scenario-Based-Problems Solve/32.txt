13. Given a paragraph:

A Core i7 laptop price is 85000 tk and a gaming mouse
price is 2500 tk. If I buy the laptop and 1 piece of
mouse, what will be my total cost after giving 15% 
discount?
Extract the digits and calculate the final cost
after the discount.

âœ… Output: 74,375 tk

================================================

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int laptop_price = 85000;
    int mouse_price = 2500;

    int total = (laptop_price + mouse_price);
    int discount = (total * 15) / 100;

    cout << "After discount price: " << total-discount << " tk";

    return 0;
}
